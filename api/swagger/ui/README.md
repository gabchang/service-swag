# Swagge UI for services

This is a basic project to build a page using the `swagger.yml` file.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `docs` folder to be served as a Github Page.

It crawls the `swagger.yaml` file first to make it available for the UI page.
